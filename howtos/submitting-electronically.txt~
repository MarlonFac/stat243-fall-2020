You now each have a private GitHub repository within the stat243-fall-2019 organization on github.berkeley.edu.

To access your repository, use your CalNet credentials. The repository should be named the same as your CalNet username (i.e., whatever is before "@berkeley.edu" in your email address). Let Chris or Jared know if that doesn't seem to be the case.

Before the 2 pm deadline on the date a problem set is due you should commit your final version of the problem set to your repository with a commit message of: "final version of PS x", where 'x' is the number of the problem set.

Repository Organization

The problem sets in your repository should be organized into folders with specific filenames as follows:

your_repo/
├── ps1/
│   ├── ps1.pdf
│   ├── ps1.Rmd (.lyx, .tex, .R)
├── ps2/
│   ├── ...
├── ...
├── ps8/

The file names are case-sensitive, so please keep everything lowercase.
