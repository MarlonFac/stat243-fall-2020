# stat243-fall-2020
This repository holds all course materials for the fall 2020 offering of Statistics 243 at UC Berkeley.

This site is UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

You can view the [(DRAFT) syllabus here](https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2020/blob/master/syllabus.pdf).

Note that the various tutorials referred to in the class materials (e.g., the UNIX and bash shell tutorials, the dynamic documents tutorial, the Git tutorial, the string processing tutorial, etc.), are available [here](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials).

If you're not yet familiar with Git, go to the upper right of this page and click on 'Clone or download' and then 'Download ZIP'.

If you would like to audit the class, enroll as a UC Berkeley undergraduate, or enroll as a concurrent enrollment student (i.e., for visiting students), or for some other reason are not enrolled, please fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/j5KP7TwGgHGYQZHt8) as soon as possible. All those enrolled or wishing to take the class should have filled it out by Friday, August 28 at 5 pm.

## Logistics

Instructor office hours:

  - Chris: TBD
  - Zoe: 
     - Fridays, 1-2 pm

## Software

The `howtos` directory has information on installing and/or getting access to the software you'll need for the course. In particular, in the second week of class you'll need to get access to the UNIX command line in some fashion. See https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2020/blob/master/howtos/accessingUnixCommandLine.md for some options on how to do this. 

## Submitting assignments

The file [submitting-electronically.txt](./howtos/submitting-electronically.txt) has information on setting up a Github repository for the class and submitting your assignments by committing your solution to Github. We will discuss this in section on Friday Sep. 4.

## Online discussion and questions.

We will use the [course Piazza site](https://piazza.com/berkeley/fall2020/stat243) for communication (announcements, questions, and discussion). If you're enrolled in the class you should be a member of the group and be able to access it. If you're auditing or not yet enrolled and would like access, make sure to fill out the survey above and I will add you.
