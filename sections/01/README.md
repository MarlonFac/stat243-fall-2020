# STAT 243 - Section 1 (8/28): Optional practice in R and UNIX
This section is to give students who are less familiar in R and/or UNIX a chance to get some additional practice before the bulk of the course begins.

## R 
See the R-practice pdf above.  We will go work on these problems in groups and go through the solutions and any questions that arise. 

## UNIX 
We will use the problems from the bottom of the UNIX tutorial from the SCF linked  [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-unix-basics/blob/master/unix-basics.html). For the tutorial materials visit this [Github repo](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-unix-basics).   For those of you with little to no experience in the shell, I suggest looking over this tutorial before section.
